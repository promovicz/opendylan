Improvements
============

Documentation
-------------

The `regular-expressions <http://opendylan.org/documentation/library-reference/regular-expressions/index.html>`_ library documentation has been greatly improved.

Build Tools
-----------

Our configure script now supports the multiarch layout used on recent Debian systems.

``OPEN_DYLAN_PLATFORM_NAME`` is now ``OPEN_DYLAN_TARGET_PLATFORM`` to make
the intent more clear. Additionally, this value is available to Jam as
``TARGET_NAME``.

Cross-compilation by setting ``OPEN_DYLAN_TARGET_PLATFORM`` in the environment
is also improved, so long as the proper run-time libraries have been built.

Libraries
---------

I/O
^^^

A function ``stream-console?`` has been added to the ``<file-stream>`` class,
this can be used to determine whether console output has been directed to a
file.

A new method ``force-out`` has been added to the ``format-out`` module.
This method allows avoiding to import the ``streams`` and ``standard-io`` modules when all you want is to flush the stream corresponding to ``format-out``.

network
^^^^^^^

The bindings ``$local-host`` and ``$loopback-address`` are removed. The function ``local-host-name`` is now provided which returns the host name.
The main reason for this change was ongoing confusion by the way the network library initialized itself (calling ``gethostname`` and passing its result to ``gethostbyname``, which does not work on all computers).

Bug Fixes
=========

I/O
---

Several cases of missing locking where fixed in the ``io`` library.
The added locking may cause changes in performance.
If you encounter this you can mitigate by disabling locking on affected streams.
We are considering a switch to an opt-in locking scheme to improve performance.
